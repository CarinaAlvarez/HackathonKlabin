![interface](/images/interface-main-page.png)
For a better visualization of the proposed solutions, we created a propotype interface of the access to the data provided by the gamification of Luna. It would be accessable for all emplyees, with the expection of the "Status da Klabin" section, which would be reserved for HR employees with the result of the feedbacks received. In this interface, there would be the total points of the employee and the total points of his/hers department. There would also be a section named "Placar de Pontos", where it would be possible to see your individual position and position of your department, as well as the prizes of that round, stimulating a friendly competition to interact more with Luna. At the "Histórico de Pontos" section, the employee could observe their evolution at obtaining points in the last 3 months, as well as the evolution of their department, creating the enthusiasm of wanting to overcome their past performances.

The presented interface, in this case, would be from the HR employee, as it presents, also, the "Status Klabin" section, which ilustrates the general situation of the group of feedbacks by a WordCloud, a graphic of relations between the positive and negative feedbacks, a graphic of the percent evolution of positive feedbacks from the last 3 months and a subsection of "Redflags". The WordCloud represents the words used most frequently on the feedbacks. The subsection "Redflags" presents the feedbacks that present improper terms, that are divided in sexist, racist, lgbtq+phobics and other terms. This report about improper terms allows the HR to identify and, therefore, solve problems at the work place, obtaining an harmonic and pleasent work place for all.

Another tool in this interface is the chat with Luna. As we did not have access to the code used for Luna´s interations, we created a chat that allows a simple interation, but with questions that aim to obtain answers equivalent to feedbacks and, consequently, material for a subsequent feeling´s analyses. Right after the interation with Luna, the employee can verify, reloading the web page, that his/her points increased. Another extra proposal is that it would be allowed for Luna to receive files through the chat, in order to make it easier to employee to send files of medical certificates.

## Interface
- Clone the interface´s repository 
- Execute `npm install`
- Execute `npm start`
- The interface should open automatically, in case this does not occur, access localhost:3000

#### Attention all files must be at the same root folder 
-It may also be necessary to execute `npm run-scripts build` at the interface´s folder
-The backend of this solution can be obtained at https://github.com/felipedamin/backend-django
